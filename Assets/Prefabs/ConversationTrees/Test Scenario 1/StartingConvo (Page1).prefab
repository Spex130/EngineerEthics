  - "\u25D9Boss: Scott, I need you to take over Becky\u2019s work today. She\u2019s
    handling a couple other projects and dealing with a conference a state over."
  - "Boss: You\u2019re the only other one who\u2019s qualified here to handle it,
    and I want it done soon."
  - 'Scott: Yes sir, what project was she working on?'
  - "Boss: The one from Nalco Company. We\u2019re looking at renovating a waste treatment
    system for some of the local plants. Apparently the old ones have been struggling
    to keep up with all the post-treatment disposal."
  - "Boss: Local communities been raising a stink about it, and you\u2019re the only
    one here besides Becky who knows anything about these systems."
  - "\u2642Scott: Two extra years in Environmental Engineering finally paid off."
  - "\u25D9Scott: I should be able to handle the project sir, did Becky leave anything
    behind I could look at?"
  - 'Boss: All her notes and records on the project should be at her desk on the left.
    If you need anything else just let me know.'
  - 'Boss: For the most part, I just need you to approve the plan and get it going
    to production. The project deadline is in about three days so no rush.'
  - "\u2642Scott: Alright, should be a simple enough job. I still need to finish off
    the project I was walking on previously. Shouldn\u2019t be too much work. Becky\u2019s
    a responsible girl, works hard, and is really sweet. I have to do a good job,
    don\u2019t want to let her down."
